# Orthrus Event Store

## Architecture

### Setup

The event-store need to be compatible with serverless functions. We don't check for required tables and db on every boot, rather provide scripts for one time setup. Please run the scripts against your db one time to have proper table and functions setup.

## TODO

[] Support nodejs streams to get api calls
